# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

Welcome to my Terraform Bootcamp README file on GitHub! This README file is my journaling to getting started with exampro bootcamp and outlines the objectives I aim to achieve during my learning journey. Not a beginner with terraform, but hope to achieve more hands-on project execution on here.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the Terraform Beginner Bootcamp, the expectation is that I will have gained the following knowledge:

**Learn how to work in a Team Management platform: eg.**
Discord
Learn the basic operations of IaC:

**Terraform**

Learn scripting: eg.

**HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**
Bash scripting
Learn how to do basic git operations: eg.

**Pull Request**
Commit
Merge
Push
Branching

**Learn how to ask good questions for help:**
Screenshots via your computer
Syntax highlighting code samples
Basic Markdown
Proof-of-Effort
Referencing or linking to specific code samples eg. Stackoverflow, Gist

**How to use Github to write documentation:**
Creating and updating files
Uploading images and assets

**Writing Github Flavored markdown**
How to use a CDE:

Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)

## Getting Started

Before diving into the bootcamp, I have made sure that I have the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub account (if you're reading this, you likely have one!).
- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice (mine is vscode).
- Terraform CLI installed on my local machine.
- AWS CLI installed on my local machine.

## Resources

Throughout the bootcamp, you'll find a wealth of resources to aid your learning:

- **Module Documents**: Each module contains detailed documentation and hands-on exercises.
- **Code Examples**: Sample Terraform configurations are provided for you to practice with and others i previously created.
- **Discussion Forums**: Engage with fellow bootcamp participants and ask questions in our online discussion forums.
- **Further Reading**: Recommend books, articles, and official documentation to deepen your Terraform knowledge.

## Conclusion

I hope to find this Terraform Bootcamp an enriching learning experience. By the end of this program, I should up my skills to effectively manage infrastructure as code using Terraform and GitHub. Let's embark on this exciting journey to Terraform mastery together!
